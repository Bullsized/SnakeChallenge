# codeweek-varna-2017
A Snake Game I made live during EU Code Week Varna 2017. 
The game is created in C# and is entirely Console Based.

# Challenges left for attendees after the conference
Since we didn't have that much time during the conference to create the fully functional Snake Game (And I need a call to action), I have left some challenges for all attendees to extend the game in their home.

# Challenges
* Snake should not be able to move "backwards" and eat itself
* apple should not spawn over snake
* make apple respawn after timeout
* Add score
* Make the "Play screen smaller"
* Display score at top right
* Add border walls
* (For Pros) Add a second player
